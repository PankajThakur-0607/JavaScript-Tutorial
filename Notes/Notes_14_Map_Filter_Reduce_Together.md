Combining `map()` and `reduce()` in JavaScript can be a powerful way to transform and aggregate data in a single flow. Each function plays a specific role:

- **`map()`**: Transforms each element in an array into something new.
- **`reduce()`**: Accumulates all elements in an array into a single value, such as a sum, object, or concatenated string.

### How `map()` and `reduce()` Work Together

You can first use `map()` to transform the data and then use `reduce()` to aggregate the result of that transformation. Let’s walk through some examples to show how they work together.

### Syntax

```javascript
const result = array
  .map(element => /* transformation */)
  .reduce((accumulator, currentValue) => /* aggregation */, initialValue);
```

### Example 1: Sum of Squared Numbers

Let’s say you want to first square each number and then get the sum of those squared numbers.

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];

// First square each number, then sum them
const sumOfSquares = numbers
  .map(num => num * num)
  .reduce((acc, num) => acc + num, 0);

console.log(sumOfSquares); // Output: 30
```

### Example 2: Extracting and Summing Specific Fields in an Array of Objects

Suppose you have an array of products, and you want to first extract the prices and then sum them up.

```javascript
const products = [
  { name: "Laptop", price: 1500 },
  { name: "Tablet", price: 300 },
  { name: "Phone", price: 800 }
];

// First map to extract prices, then reduce to sum them
const totalCost = products
  .map(product => product.price)
  .reduce((acc, price) => acc + price, 0);

console.log(totalCost); // Output: 2600
```

### Example 3: Count Total Characters in an Array of Strings

In this example, we use `map()` to get the length of each string, and then use `reduce()` to sum the total characters across all strings.

```javascript
const words = ["hello", "world", "JavaScript"];

// Map to get lengths, then reduce to sum them
const totalCharacters = words
  .map(word => word.length)
  .reduce((acc, length) => acc + length, 0);

console.log(totalCharacters); // Output: 20
```

### Example 4: Combining Complex Transformations

Let’s say you want to filter products based on price, transform the result into a specific structure using `map()`, and then reduce it to aggregate information like the total cost.

```javascript
const products = [
  { name: "Laptop", price: 1500, available: true },
  { name: "Tablet", price: 300, available: false },
  { name: "Phone", price: 800, available: true }
];

// First filter, then map to get prices, finally reduce to sum the total cost
const totalAvailableCost = products
  .filter(product => product.available) // Filter only available products
  .map(product => product.price)        // Map to extract the price
  .reduce((acc, price) => acc + price, 0); // Reduce to sum up the prices

console.log(totalAvailableCost); // Output: 2300
```

### Example 5: Transforming and Aggregating Complex Objects

Suppose you have an array of orders, and each order contains items. You want to get the total revenue from all the orders by mapping over the items and then reducing the prices.

```javascript
const orders = [
  { orderId: 1, items: [{ name: "Laptop", price: 1500 }, { name: "Mouse", price: 50 }] },
  { orderId: 2, items: [{ name: "Tablet", price: 300 }] },
  { orderId: 3, items: [{ name: "Phone", price: 800 }, { name: "Charger", price: 20 }] }
];

// First map to get all item prices, then reduce to sum the prices
const totalRevenue = orders
  .map(order => order.items.map(item => item.price))  // Map to get prices from each order's items
  .flat()                                            // Flatten the array of arrays
  .reduce((acc, price) => acc + price, 0);           // Sum the prices

console.log(totalRevenue); // Output: 2670
```

### How `map()` and `reduce()` Work in This Example

1. **`map()`**: In this example, `map()` is used to transform the orders into an array of prices (`item.price`).
2. **`flat()`**: Since the transformation returns an array of arrays (an array of item prices for each order), we use `flat()` to flatten the array into a single array of all item prices.
3. **`reduce()`**: Finally, we use `reduce()` to sum the prices together to get the total revenue.

### Key Points to Remember
- `map()` is great for transforming data, creating a new array where each element is altered.
- `reduce()` is used when you want to accumulate values into a single result.
- You can chain `map()` and `reduce()` to transform and aggregate data in one go, but each function serves a distinct purpose.
