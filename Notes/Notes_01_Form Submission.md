No, submitting a form using the default **HTML form submission** (via the submit button) and submitting it **programmatically using JavaScript** are not exactly the same. They differ in how they behave and what level of control you have over the form submission process.



### 1. **Default Form Submission (Using Submit Button)**
When you submit a form using the submit button (or pressing Enter inside a form field), the form data is automatically sent to the server without the need for any additional scripting.

#### Key Features:
- **Automatic Submission**: The form is submitted to the URL specified in the `action` attribute using the method specified in the `method` attribute (`GET` or `POST`).
- **Page Reload**: By default, the browser will reload the page (or navigate to the URL in the `action`) once the form is submitted.
- **Less Control**: You don't have much control over how the data is sent or how the submission is handled unless you prevent the default behavior using JavaScript.

#### Example:
```html
<form action="/submit_form.php" method="POST">
  <label for="email">Email:</label>
  <input type="email" id="email" name="email" required>
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```
In this example, when the submit button is clicked, the form data is sent to `/submit_form.php` and the browser reloads or redirects to that page.


### 2. **Form Submission Using JavaScript (`form.submit()` or AJAX)**
When you use JavaScript to submit a form, you have full control over the process. You can validate the data, prevent the page from reloading, and send the form data asynchronously using AJAX.

#### Key Features:
- **Programmatic Control**: Using JavaScript (`form.submit()` or AJAX), you control when and how the form is submitted.
- **No Page Reload (Using AJAX)**: You can prevent the page from reloading by handling the form submission through JavaScript.
- **Validation**: You can validate the form fields before the form is submitted and only submit if everything is correct.
- **Custom Behavior**: You can define custom actions upon successful or failed submission.

#### Example of `form.submit()`:
```html
<form id="myForm">
  <label for="email">Email:</label>
  <input type="email" id="email" name="email" required>
  <button type="button" onclick="submitForm()">Submit via JavaScript</button>
</form>

<script>
  function submitForm() {
    const form = document.getElementById('myForm');
    
    // You can add custom validation here if needed

    // Submit the form programmatically
    form.submit();
  }
</script>
```

In this case, the form will only be submitted when the JavaScript function `submitForm()` is called. You can add validation or custom behavior before calling `form.submit()`.

#### Example of AJAX Submission:
```html
<form id="myForm">
  <label for="email">Email:</label>
  <input type="email" id="email" name="email" required>
  <button type="submit">Submit via AJAX</button>
</form>

<script>
  document.getElementById('myForm').addEventListener('submit', function(event) {
    event.preventDefault(); // Prevent the default form submission

    const formData = new FormData(this); // Create a FormData object

    // Use Fetch API to submit the form asynchronously (AJAX)
    fetch('/submit_form.php', {
      method: 'POST',
      body: formData
    })
    .then(response => response.text())
    .then(result => {
      console.log('Form submitted successfully:', result);
    })
    .catch(error => {
      console.error('Error submitting form:', error);
    });
  });
</script>
```

In this example, the form is submitted using JavaScript with AJAX (using the Fetch API), and the page will not reload. You can handle the form data and server response directly in JavaScript.

### **Key Differences Between Default Submission and JavaScript Submission:**

| Aspect                   |**Default Form Submission**                    |**JavaScript Form Submission**               |
|------------------------- |-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Page Reload**          | Page reloads after form submission            | No page reload (if using AJAX)              |
| **Form Control**         | Limited control over submission behavior      | Full control over submission and validation |
| **Validation**           | Can use HTML5 form validation                 | Custom validation can be added in JavaScript|
| **Customization**        | Harder to customize behavior                  | Easier to customize the process             |
| **AJAX (Asynchronous)**  | Not possible by default (page reload)         | Possible using Fetch, XMLHttpRequest, etc.  |

### Conclusion:
- **Default form submission** is simpler and works automatically, but you have less control.
- **JavaScript form submission** gives you more flexibility and allows for better control over validation, user feedback, and preventing page reloads (especially useful for AJAX).
